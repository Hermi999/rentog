  # Logging level for log/newrelic_agent.log
  log_level: info

  # The newrelic agent communicates with the RPM service via http by
  # default.  If you want to communicate via https to increase
  # security, then turn on SSL by setting this value to true.  Note,
  # this will result in increased CPU overhead to perform the
  # encryption involved in SSL communication, but this work is done
  # asynchronously to the threads that process your application code,
  # so it should not impact response times.
  ssl: false

  # EXPERIMENTAL: enable verification of the SSL certificate sent by
  # the server. This setting has no effect unless SSL is enabled
  # above. This may block your application. Only enable it if the data
  # you send us needs end-to-end verified certificates.
  #
  # This means we cannot cache the DNS lookup, so each request to the
  # service will perform a lookup. It also means that we cannot
  # use a non-blocking lookup, so in a worst case, if you have DNS
  # problems, your app may block indefinitely.

  #============================== Browser Monitoring ===============================
  # New Relic Real User Monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are
  # experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for
  # your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount
  # of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page.
  browser_monitoring:
      # By default the agent automatically injects the monitoring JavaScript
      # into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior.
      auto_instrument: true

  # Proxy settings for connecting to the service.
  #
  # If a proxy is used, the host setting is required.  Other settings
  # are optional.  Default port is 8080.

  # Tells transaction tracer and error collector (when enabled)
  # whether or not to capture HTTP params.  When true, frameworks can
  # exclude HTTP parameters from being captured.
  # Rails: the RoR filter_parameter_logging excludes parameters
  # Java: create a config setting called "ignored_params" and set it to
  #     a comma separated list of HTTP parameter names.
  #     ex: ignored_params: credit_card, ssn, password
  capture_params: false

  # Transaction tracer captures deep information about slow
  # transactions and sends this to the RPM service once a
  # minute. Included in the transaction is the exact call sequence of
  # the transactions including any SQL statements issued.
  transaction_tracer:

    # Transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to
    # turn it off. This feature is only available at the Silver and
    # above product levels.
    enabled: true

    # Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction
    # trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds
    # this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to
    # RPM. Valid values are any float value, or (default) "apdex_f",
    # which will use the threshold for an dissatisfying Apdex
    # controller action - four times the Apdex T value.
    transaction_threshold: apdex_f

    # When transaction tracer is on, SQL statements can optionally be
    # recorded. The recorder has three modes, "off" which sends no
    # SQL, "raw" which sends the SQL statement in its original form,
    # and "obfuscated", which strips out numeric and string literals
    record_sql: obfuscated

    # Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack trace for a SQL
    # call. In other words, when SQL statements exceed this threshold,
    # then capture and send to RPM the current stack trace. This is
    # helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from
    stack_trace_threshold: 0.500

    # Determines whether the agent will capture query plans for slow
    # SQL queries.  Only supported in mysql and postgres.  Should be
    # set to false when using other adapters.

    # Threshold for query execution time below which query plans will not
    # not be captured.  Relevant only when `explain_enabled` is true.
    # explain_threshold: 0.5

  # Error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and
  # sends them to RPM for viewing
  error_collector:

    # Error collector is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn
    # it off. This feature is only available at the Silver and above
    # product levels
    enabled: true

    # Rails Only - tells error collector whether or not to capture a
    # source snippet around the place of the error when errors are View
    # related.
    capture_source: true

    # To stop specific errors from reporting to RPM, set this property
    # to comma separated values.  Default is to ignore routing errors
    # which are how 404's get triggered.
    #
    # NB: ignores for other services are defined in airbrake.rb,
    # consider keeping them in sync!

# Application Environments
# ------------------------------------------
# Environment specific settings are in this section.
# For Rails applications, RAILS_ENV is used to determine the environment
# For Java applications, pass -Dnewrelic.environment <environment> to set
# the environment

# NOTE if your application has other named environments, you should
# provide newrelic configuration settings for these environments here.

# Environment-specific settings are in this section.
# RAILS_ENV or RACK_ENV (as appropriate) is used to determine the environment.
# If your application has other named environments, configure them here.
